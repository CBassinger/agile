The idea behind this work is to test our program functionality throughout the development process.
The end result will be a more robust product that requires less upkeep investment.

The plan is to creat an immortization program with a menu structure that can be built upon.
Bugs are our friend since they give us a chance to write a test script in Python or Ruby.
